These are the problems I solved while studying the courses of cs50 Introduction to computer science __
In this file you can find the bullet points I learnt from this certificate



## 1.c Programming 

compiler converts source code into a machine code( using the command make)
google more interpreter and compiler and the make we use in c language 
we use abstraction to create our own functions ; its like creating an ordinary function then calling it using its name 
the use of long instead of int:
The type long is used where the type int is not that large to hold the desired value. The range of long is –9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 which is quite large, to hold the larger values like big whole numbers.  
The basic difference between the type int and long is of their width where int is  32 bit, and long is 64 bits.
the memory required to hold the value of type int is less as compared to long.
Double is twice as big as the float( just like int and long) 
Command line:
ls : seing the list of files and directories under the current directory
cd : change directory ; go to a certain directory 
 mkdir :make a directory 
cp s d : copy source destination  // this is if we wanna copy a file , but if we wanna copy a folder we have to write “ cp -r s d”
rm : to remove a file 
rm -r folerName : to remove a folder 
mv : move from one location to another
